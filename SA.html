					<h2>El Calafate</h2>
					<p>Beautiful spot, but you don't need more than a day and a half or so. Its a good in-between spot to get between places.</p>
					<img src="images/pat1.png">
						<ul>
							<li>America Del sur hostel was clean and fun but far from the bus stop. Communal atmosphere and offer a bbq dinner every night and free breakfast</li>
							<li>Perrito Moreno - incredible glacier, can see it falling. Possible to do ice treks and boat rides. Try to find an alternative to the full day your, it's really cool but that takes too long.  If you have an afternoon or half day on wl calafate, the wetland nimez walk takes about and hour or more and is beautiful. Tons of different birds including flamingos and views of the lakes.</li>

					<h2>El Chalten</h2>
					<p>I think this is my favorite place in Patagonia. It is a sleepy town in the middle of the canyons that has so many beautiful hikes and fun things to do. I would budget 2-3 nights here.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>rancho grande hostel was great, good food, wifi, communal atmosphere similar to America Del sur. It's furthest from the bus stop but closes to the hikes</li>
							<li>Hikes : big one and must do is Laguna de los tres to get a view of Fitzroy. It's gorgeous and the first and last km were very steep. I didn't, but I truly wish I had walking sticks for this hike bc my knees paid for it. Allow plenty of time and be sure at the top of the hike to check out the view on the left side of the lake because their is another lake. </li>
							<li>another hike to do is Laguna de los torres, very foggy when I went and the coolest part was the ice bergs in the lake at the top. I enjoyed the hike a lot but also heard great things about los cerros.</li>
							<li>we went to viejo nando, wafleriA, and the cerveseria and they were all fun spots</li>

					<p>4-5 Day Hike depending at the speed you take it at. You can go either east to west, or west to east. On this one trek, you pass glaciers, valleys, lakes, a rock beach, and see incredible views. It almost feels like a ski-lodge atmosphere at each of the camping areas/refugios.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Before the hike, we stayed at a nice hotel (costautralis or something) in Puerto Natales which was great but I may also recommend to actually sleep in the park the first night, I heard Torres hotel is nice. Otherwise we didn't get to actually start our first day till the afternoon. In Puerto Natales, we liked cafe el living and loved dinner at afrigonia (you have to make a reservation but its easy to do so). </li>
						</ul>
				</div>
				<div id= "wtrekcol2">
							<ul>
							<li>We went west to east so we walked up and stayed at glacier grey the first night. (A note about w to e rather than e to west, I think the views get better the whole way east, but they're good enough the whole time that it doesn't matter. Also west to east is slightly more uphill which is better for the knees. It also leaves the steepest days for the end which could be either good or bad). If you camp, most campsites let you rent tents from there. Bring poles. And a rain coat. And hiking boots/snacks etc. you can pull water straight from the streams, which rocks.</li>
							<li>About an hour past the Refugio is a view above the glacier. If you started early, you could get there in time to do kayaking or glacier trekking, (or return back and sleep at the paine grande Refugio.) Then day two we trek down to Paine grande and then up through Italian valley to the French domo.
							Food at the Refugios are easy and plenty but try to be there by 5 pm to reserve it. They'll feed you I imagine regardless plus have little mini markets with some snacks and boxed wine. They don't sell pain meds on the mountain but you can beg a Refugio worker, I'd bring plenty. Refugios are a lot like ski lodges, happy worn out people sitting at communal tables gearing up or down. </li>
							<li>Day 3, went from French back up to the left up to the britanica lookout and then back down to sleep at cuernos. All of this is adjustable, but you have to see if there are open reservations at the next place if you want to sleep elsewhere.</li>
							<li>Day 4: we made it a big day but it doesn't have to be. We were running on adrenaline and what not but decided to finish that day so we went from cuernos up to the torres lookout and then back all the way down to the bottom. I would definitely suggest sleeping at chileno rather than torre for that night, otherwise you have to retrace a lot of steps.</li>
							<li>I loved walking along the big turquoise lake (mainly day 3 and 4), seeing the glacier day 1, and the view from the top of Torres (though it's very similar to fitz roy in el chalten)</li>
							<li>Food at the Refugio are easy to set up and are plentiful but try to be there by 5 pm to reserve it</li>

					<p>Quito is a bustling city with lots to do and see. I would recommend 3 days or so to see the major sites, maybe less, but leave some time to do day trips around Quito too.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Oswaldo Guayasamino Casa y Museo: cool museum that the home was built around. Outside there is a cool modern museum of his work.</li>
							<li>We stayed in the Secret Garden, Quito. It was a fun hostel with lots going on and a lively atmosphere. It was in a good part of town and served decent food and had good wifi. It has an incredible view of the city</li>
							<li>The hostal offers a really nice walking tour around Quito where you get to learn about the old town.</li>
							<li> Every Monday at 11AM the president of Ecuador comes out of the presidential palace and there is a cool procession and speech.</li>
							<li>Going to see the Equator line is actually pretty cool. There is a kitchy display of how things the effects of gravity at the equator which was more fun that I was expecting.</li>
							<li>La Ronda is a cute area to go out in and have a dinner, a little overpriced though.</li>
							<li>You can take the teleferico up the mountain and see a view of the whole city. I wouldn't recommend this if you're short on time, but if you have time, or the lung capacity, it may be nice to hike around up there.</li>
						</ul>
						<div class ="row2">
						<ul>	
							<li>The great basilica was actually a really cool way thing to see. It has a tower that you can climb up that is actually very high and scary which is fun. At the top, there is a cafe that you can sit and drink and look out over the city.</li>
							<li>Itchimbia Park: a park a little south of the hostel that has the "Quito" sign you can take a picture of and just have a nice relaxing hang in a park.</li>

				<p>Traveling to the Galapagos feels like you're traveling back in time. Everything is so preserved but whats also crazy is how comfortable the animals are with you being so close to them. People say that you need a full week to do the Galapagos, which is probably true, but we did it in just a few days staying on land. If you have the time to do a longer trip, it would be better but if time is limited and you want to pack in as much as possible, here is what we did! </p>
			<div class ="galapagosinfo">
			<img src="images/galap.png">
				<p>In the Galapagos, I stayed on the Santa Cruz island. We stayed at the Lonely George Hostal, which was cool, but it seemed like there were lots of great options. </p>
				<p>We went on multiple day excurisions, walking to tortuga bay, where we rented kayaks, saw iguanas and a turtle, and chilled on the beach. We took the water taxi back.</p>
				<p>We went to a tortoise reserve in the Highlands that afternoon and saw over 50 tortiouses, some over 150 years old. They come there naturally. This was really amazing to see. Your can pay $40 for the whole car and the guide will take you there, to a big crater, and to crawl through lava tunnels.</p>
				<p>The next day we went on an organized boat trip that picked us up from the hostal and took us snorkeling, boating, and to the North Seymour Islands where we got to see hte Blue-footed Boobies, Friggets, and Land Iguannas. It is beautiful and takes up most of the day. </p>
				<p>We went to check out the Darwin museum too, but after the live sitings, seeing the tortiouses etc in the museum seemed less exciting. Behind the Darwin museum though, there is an isolated beach covered in Iguanas which was fun to explore.</p>
				<p>Restaurants: Solymar (food wasn't awesome, but on the water and has a pool), bongo (where the nightlight in Santa Cruz is but drinks are very overpriced),  Pizza Eat, and La Garrapata</p>

				<h3>Cotopaxi/Quilotoa</h3>

				<p>Cotopaxi and Quilotoa a multi-day trip options from Quito. Cotopaxi is the major volcano outside of Quito that has acutally been active for the past 6 months or so. Though that is cool, it makes it hard to get close or do cool things on the volcano. Quilotoa is also south of Quito and is an awesome gigantic crater. This was one of the coolest sites.</p>
				<div id= "cotopaxiinfo">
					<img src="images/paxi.png">
						<p>In Cotopaxi, we stayed at the Secret Garden Cotopaxi. I would greatly recommend taking one of the shuttles from Latacunga that the hostel sets up, otherwise you're in for a really long day. The hostel is awesome though and very remote. You can see the volcano from your door, they have giant nets that serve as big hammocks, have big family style meals and provide lots of activities and some partying. Due to our short time, we did the biking activity, but there is also hiking, horseback riding, and a nature walk. They are offering some package for a 3/4 day special so if you're going in the near future, i would see if this is still an option</p>
				</div>
						<p>Quilotoa can be a bit of a pain to get to, but definitely worth it. the crater is massive. You can walk all the way around it, but we were cautioned against that because it is a 6 hour walk or so and the scenery doesn't change much. Instead we walked down to the bottom. You can rent kayaks down there. We opted for the horseback ride back up, which saved our energy and was not more than $10. Horses were slow moving, but they had character.Getting from Cotopaxi to Quilotoa to Quito all in one day was a lot. I may suggest that you plan to go to quilotoa in route to Banos or something. </p>
